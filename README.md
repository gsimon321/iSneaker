# iSneaker
Web-based application for accessing and manipulating the iSneaker Store database. Employees are able to login to the site  and  access company wide and store  specific  information. The five main functionalities of the site  allow an employee to 
1. View the most  popular selling brand of Shoe.
2. Find the closest store's to a customer's location that have the item that a customer is looking for.
3. View which employee has the  greatest sales/salary ratio within their store.
4. Insert an additional Shoe Item into the database.
5. Track all  the current  orders across the company.

These functionalities were chosen in order to demonstrate complex mysql queries that can  be seen within the index.js file.
